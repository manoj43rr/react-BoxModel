# CSS Box Model React Project

Welcome to the CSS Box Model React Project! This project is a React-based website designed to provide an informative overview of the basic properties of the CSS Box Model. 

## Project Overview

The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design that defines how the dimensions and spacing of HTML elements are calculated. This project showcases the key properties of the Box Model, including:

- **Content**: The actual content of the element.
- **Padding**: Space between the content and the border.
- **Border**: The border surrounding the padding (if any).
- **Margin**: Space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.

## Features

- **Interactive Components**: Learn about each property with interactive examples.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.
- **Styling**: Uses CSS Modules for scoped and manageable styling.
